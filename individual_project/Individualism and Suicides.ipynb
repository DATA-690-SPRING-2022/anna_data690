        "Suicide is an important global health issue. It is estimated that 800,000 deaths per year occur due to suicide (1) and it is the fourth leading cause of death for youth 15-19 years old (2). Risk factors for suicide include mental health issues, alcohol and drug abuse, stress, abuse and trauma. Although there is a significant mental health aspect to this issue, social factors play a critical role in individuals’ risk of suicide. World Bank data offers a glimpse into how cultural factors are affecting this issue. In particular, I would like to look into how a country’s level of individualism affects suicide rates, using the World Bank data available at World Development Explorer (worlddev.xyz).\n",
