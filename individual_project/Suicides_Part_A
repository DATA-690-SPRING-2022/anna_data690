Suicide is an important global health issue. It is estimated that 800,000 deaths per year occur due to suicide (1) and it is the fourth leading cause of death for youth 15-19 years old (2). Risk factors for suicide include mental health issues, alcohol and drug abuse, , stress, abuse and trauma. Although there is a significant mental health aspect to this issue,, social factors play a critical role in individuals’ risk of suicide. World Bank data offers a glimpse into how cultural factors are affecting this issue. In particular, I’ll look into how a country’s level of individualism affects suicide rates. 

##Global Outlook

To look at suicide rates across the world, we'll use World Development Explorer (worlddev.xyz). Below are the countries with the highest and lowest suicide rates, based on 2019 World Bank data:

Lesotho, a country in Sub-Saharan Africa, has the largest suicide rate in the world, 88 persons per 100,000 commit suicide - more than double the incidence compared to the average rates in the other 9 top suicide countries. The primary reasons for this are thought to be extreme poverty and a high HIV prevalence. Notably, countries with lowest suicide rates are also predominantly lower-income economies. 

Before we delve into cultural factors, it is worth understanding how suicides correlate with income, represented by GDP, and the general health status, represented in the data by life expectancy rates. We know that income is a powerful determinant of many social and health outcomes, with higher incomes typically correlating with better outcomes. We would therefore expect that suicides are generally higher in lower income countries. Fitting a simple linear regression model on GDP and suicides data does no quite support this hypothesis: in fact, there is a slight upward trend in suicides as the country income increases. The t-test value on the slope coefficient is not very significant, at 1.57.

Similarly, looking at suicide rates across the life expectancy ranges, we would expect that more suicides tend to occur in countries where healthcare system is lacking, affecting both mental health and the general health status of individuals. Again, the simple linear regression of suicide rates against a country’s life expectancy does not confirm this. In fact, there appears to be a very small decrease in suicide rates as the country’s life expectancy increases, although the t-test value shows a very low statistical significance of this relationship.

Suicide trends over time
To understand how suicide rates have changed over time, we wil group countries into 5 income categories and start back at 2000. The good news is that globally, suicide rates have been decreasing across all income groups. This chart also shows that high income countries have higher suicide rates, followed by countries with lower middle income. Perhaps the stressors of living in a high income society, such as inequality of income and opportunity, can be higher than living in a country with lower overall income.
To better understand factors that lead to suicide, we will now look at society’s level of individualism vs collectivism. Although the World Bank defines individualism as a belief that government should not affect people’s choices, we associate it with high opportunity for self-realization and individual freedoms, and a lower reliance on the community. There are two different, in fact opposite, ways in which this can affect suicides: one hypothesis would be that higher individual freedoms make people happier and therefore reduce suicides; another is that a lower level of social connection makes people feel more isolated and disconnected, leading to the increase in suicides. Plotting a simple regression of suicide rates against the level of individualism, we see that there is a positive correlation between these variables, i.e. higher individualism is associated with higher suicide rates. Moreover, this relationship is statistically significant.

So, it appears that despite the many benefits that individual freedoms offer, the lower level of community connection and support can also results in a feeling of loneliness that can lead to suicides. Moreover, if we consider that an act of suicide is only the most visible and acute outcome of the mental suffering an individual goes through, it’s likely that individualism is a factor in other mental health issues, such as stress and depression. It is therefore very important to create and strengthen communities and foster social support through schools, work organizations and places of worship, while respecting individual freedoms.
